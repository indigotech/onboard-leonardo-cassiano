## Enviroment and Tools

The project is been developed in a MacOS machine, Android studio is been used to emulate the aplication in a virtual device for android systems and Xcode version 12.4 to emulate in Ios systems.
The programming languages used in the project are Javascript, react-native, typescript.

## Steps to run and debug

To run the project it is necessary to open the project with android studio or Xcode, after that, it is possible to use your own device or a emulated virtual device, that must be inicialized before running the aplication in a terminal. 

To do so, open a terminal inside the project and run the following commando:

Let this terminal run freely, open another terminal in the project and run:

npx react-native run-android

If everything is working well, it must open the aplication in your device or emulated virtual device.
